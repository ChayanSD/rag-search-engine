# RAG Search Engine

A simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) search engine that combines vector similarity search with large language models to provide intelligent, context-aware search results.

## Overview

This project implements a RAG-based search engine that:
- Embeds documents and queries using transformer-based models
- Performs efficient vector similarity search
- Augments LLM responses with relevant document context
- Provides accurate, grounded answers to user queries
